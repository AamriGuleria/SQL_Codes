-- Given a table of job postings, write a query to retrieve the number of users that have posted each job only once and the number of users that have posted at least one job multiple times.

-- Each user has at least one job posting. Thus the sum of single_post and multiple_posts should equal the total number of distinct user_idâ€™s.

-- Example:

-- Input:

-- job_postings table

-- Column	Type
-- id	INTEGER
-- job_id	INTEGER
-- user_id	INTEGER
-- date_posted	DATETIME
-- Output:

-- Column	Type
-- single_post	INTEGER
-- multiple_posts	INTEGER

SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM (
         SELECT COUNT(user_id) AS user_count
         FROM job_postings
         GROUP BY job_id
         HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
     ) AS single_post) AS single_post_count,
    
    (SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM (
         SELECT COUNT(user_id) AS user_count
         FROM job_postings
         GROUP BY job_id
         HAVING COUNT(*) <> 1
     ) AS multiple_post) AS multiple_post_count;
